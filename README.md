##Retrieving comments from Google Spreadsheet

In one of our project, we are using Google Spreadsheet as a major data source. We are using Roo::Google in [Roo Gem](https://github.com/Empact/roo) to access the spreadsheet. Roo actually uses [Google Drive Ruby Gem](https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby) to communicate with [Google Spreadsheet API v3](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/#working_with_cell-based_feeds).

Everything works pretty well until recently we have to access the comments on individual cells.
![cell_comment](/comments.png "Cell Comment")

This feature is not exposed by [Google Spreadsheet API v3](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/#working_with_cell-based_feeds),
as a result, we can retrieve those comments through Roo::Google in [Roo Gem](https://github.com/Empact/roo).

We googled around a little bit, people are suggesting using cell notes since it is included when you export the spreadsheet to html format.
Cell notes is a feature before cell comments, it is lacking commentator information and other features cell comments provides.
The html Google generated from the spreadsheet actually are malformatted and very hard to attribute the note back to the cell.


```
<table dir='ltr' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class='tblGenFixed' id='tblMain'>
  <tr class='rShim'>
    <td class='rShim' style='width:0;'>
    <td class='rShim' style='width:120px;'>
  <tr dir='ltr'>
    <td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td>
    <td  class='s0'>1
  </tr>
  <tr dir='ltr'>
    <td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td>
    <td  class='s1'>2%
    <span class='annotation'> [1]</span>
  </tr>
</table>
<div class='annotations'>[1] <span>cell note</span><br></div>
```

We decide to look further. We export the spreadsheet into excelx format. since xlsx file is actually just a zip file, we were surprised when we unzip that file:

![excelx_content](/excelx.png "Excelx content")

It has a file called comments1.xml, and its content is exact what we need.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<comments xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main">
  <authors><author></author></authors>
  <commentList>
    <comment ref="A2" authorId="0"><text><t xml:space="preserve">cell note</t></text></comment>
    <comment ref="A1" authorId="0"><text><t xml:space="preserve">testing comments	-Ping Yu</t></text></comment>
  </commentList>
</comments>
```

But when we open this xlsx file with Roo::Excelx reader in [Roo Gem](https://github.com/Empact/roo), the reader cannot find any comments.
It is actually caused by a slightly different structure generated by Google with what Roo expects.
We submitted a [PR  here](https://github.com/Empact/roo/pull/95), you can use our [repo](https://github.com/intridea/roo) before the PR is merged.

Here is the code for exporting the spreadsheet and retrieve the comment:


```
def self.get_comments_from_spreadsheet
  doc = DocAuth.current_doc
  drive = GoogleDrive.login(doc.username, doc.password)

  path =
    Dir::Tmpname.make_tmpname("#{Rails.root}/tmp/raw", nil) + ".xlsx"

  drive.spreadsheet_by_key(doc.key).export_as_file(path, "xls")

  Roo::Excelx.new(path, comment_xpath: './xmlns:text/xmlns:t').comments
end
```
